# The M3Challenge

## Project Structure
Rough Directory Structure:

`cmp/` computing files (programmatic modelling/data analysis)  
`res/` static resources (data, images, external outputs, etc.)  
`tex/` LaTeX source for paper (everything for the final PDF)  

`src/` source folders  
`out/` output folders  

Try to keep everything clean and organized;  
graph/image renders from code in `cmp/` should go in `res/`...  
similarly, `src/` of `tex/` should reference files in `res/` (do not duplicate resources)
